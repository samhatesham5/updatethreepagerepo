  <h2>Top Barriers to Mental Health Access</h2>
  <h3>1) Financial Barriers</h3>
    <p> For many individuals, a lack of financial resources prevents them from seeking help at all. For others, a lack of financial resources can lead to inconsistent or inadequate treatment.</p>
    <p> Even with insurance or financial assistance, mental healthcare services can be costly. Copays and deductibles add up quickly when a diagnosis requires regular therapy, complicated medication management or intensive treatment programs.</p>
  <h3>2) Lack of Mental Health Professionals</h3>
    <p>According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, 89.3 million Americans live in federally-designated Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas (in contrast, only 55.3 million Americans live in similarly-designated primary-care shortage areas and 44.6 million live in dental health shortage areas).</p>
    <p>Rural areas often have few to no mental healthcare providers at all, let alone providers with specialties. Urban clinics and providers often have long waiting lists, and patients can suffer for months before they get a basic intake appointment.</p>
  <h3>3) Mental Health Awareness and Education</h3>
    <p>Physical injuries and illnesses are typically obvious. They don’t feel well, something hurts or some clinical test shows an abnormality. Mental illnesses, however, are often hard to recognize.</p>
    <p>Often, symptoms are subtle and might be dismissed as “personality” or “attitude” issues. Clinical anxiety may be dismissed as “worrying too much,” depression can often look like “laziness” or fatigue. If a person doesn’t know something is wrong, it’s unlikely they will seek treatment.</p>
  <h3>4) Social Sigma of Mental Health</h3>
    <p> At one end of the spectrum, their own beliefs about mental illness can prevent them from acknowledging their illness or sticking with treatment.</p>
    <p>On the other end, the very real risk of facing discrimination in social and professional circles creates a huge barrier. People may fear that family and friends will avoid them or treat them negatively. They may also be concerned that the disclosure of a mental health condition can lead to negative treatment and perceptions at work.</p>
  <h3>5) Racial Barriers to Mental Health</h3>
    <p>There are significant disparities in mental healthcare access among different racial and ethnic groups. One study looks at how the Affordable Care Act has impacted mental healthcare access. The study found that white people are the only racial group in which a majority of people with severe psychological distress get treatment. More than half of people facing severe mental illness who are Black, Hispanic or Asian don’t get treatment.</p>
    <p>Jeanne Miranda, a professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA, explains, “Minorities are often more likely to be poor, less likely to be treated by doctors of their same race and, in many cases, less likely to know they have a condition that requires professional care.”</p>
